# what i did

added a error message popup ( errorMessage() ) & a toast notification thingy ( toastMessage() )

i converted the localstorage data to objects again. go check \_getLocalStorage() & \_newWorkout() they still have their data intact. (i spent like half an hour wondering why the data has the same id lol)
not sure if what i came up with is an efficient way of doing it, but im gonna to sleep now.
