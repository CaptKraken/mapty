# what i did on top

- added a reset app button, since the function was already written.
- set pin marker of current location when map loads.
- set current location to Phnom Penh, Cambodia if user doesn't allow location.
- map zoom level updates every time the map is zoomed (i seriously don't know why i did that lol)
- added a error message popup ( errorMessage() ) & a toast notification thingy ( toastMessage() )
- added a delete workout function
- i converted the localstorage data to objects again. go check \_getLocalStorage() & \_newWorkout() they still have their data intact. (i spent like half an hour wondering why the data has the same id lol)

not sure if what i came up with is an efficient way of doing it, but im gonna to sleep now.
